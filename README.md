## Project Overview
This is my final project for IT Elective 4: a fully responsive personal portfolio website. The website serves as my digital resume, showcasing my biography, technical skills, and a collection of academic and personal projects. It includes the following sections:

- **Hero Section:** A visually appealing introduction with my name, title, and a "View My Work" button.  
- **About Me:** A professional biography, profile photo, and overview of my background.  
- **Skills:** A visual representation of my technical skills using progress bars and icons.  
- **Projects Gallery:** At least three project cards, each containing a title, image, description, and a link to the live demo or code.  
- **Contact:** Contact information, social media links, and a form (functional or visual) for inquiries.

The website is fully responsive and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Semantic HTML5 elements, clean CSS styling, and modern deployment workflows are used throughout.
